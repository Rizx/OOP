God object (Monster Object) know too much, or do too much; 
God objects are nasty beasts. The term God object was coined because these objects are said to be “all-knowing”. 
I’m in favor of the term Monster objects because knowing something isn’t a bad thing. 
These objects are usually bad things and Monsters are both big and bad, I find that more fitting. 
There are several problems with this anti-pattern. 
The two problems I most often see are testability problems and violating the Law(Suggestion) of Demeter.
